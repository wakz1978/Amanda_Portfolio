As a dedicated data analyst with a background in retail, I bring a unique perspective to data interpretation and insights. 

Graduate of Macquarie University and University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

My projects focus on SQL, Python, Tableau and Azure Synapse Analytics.

Balancing my professional life with being a mother I understand the importance of making informed decisions that impact both work and family.

Born in New Zealand, schooled in Hong Kong and Kobe, Japan, living in Australia since 1996, others find my perspective to be global and unique.

I enjoy listening and playing music, guitar, and walking my dogs on the beach with my family, including my beautiful South Coast of NSW with my 11-year-old daughter.
