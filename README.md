# Amanda Wright Data Analyst Portfolio

Graduate of Macquarie University(2003) and University of New South Wales(2024) in Sydney, Australia.

As a dedicated data analyst with a background in retail, I bring a unique perspective to data interpretation and insights.

My projects in this portfolio focus on SQL, Python, Tableau, R and Azure Synapse Analytics.

Born in New Zealand, schooled in Hong Kong and Kobe, Japan, living in Australia since 1996, others find my perspective to be global and unique.

I enjoy listening and playing music, guitar, and walking my dogs on the beach with my family, including my beautiful South Coast of NSW with my 11-year-old daughter.
